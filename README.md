# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing
## Project Motivation
The motive of this project is to have you a taste of the environment and tools
you will most likely come across in a front end role. Your focus should be to
understand the role every tool and technology is playing in the overall
architecture. You shouldnâ€™t feel the need to memorize the particular commands,
config setups, or structure that we create here. Every project in the industry
will have its own custom setup, but if you understand the moving pieces, you
will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this one.

## Project Introduccion - What You Will Build
We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing
(NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an
application to understand the human language, written or oral.

You don't have to worry about NLP, because we will make use of an external
api called MeaningCloud to interact with their NLP system. This tool will help us
classify the information available in the article, like whether the content is
subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive,
neutral, or negative in tone.

Following are the project prerequisites:

* Webserver - Node
* Web application framework for routing - Express
* Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and
  prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
* External script - Service Worker
* External API - MeaningCloud
